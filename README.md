Battle Game with Fantasy Creatures 
------------
STEPS:

- Allow user to decide which two fantasy creatures to battle.
- Use those two fantasy creatures to simulate a fight, with “rounds”, and display/format the results.
- The fights will involve the use of attack and defense, which will be determined through the use of a Dice class.
- Each fantasy creature will have unique attack, defense, strength(health), armor, and a special ability/condition.
- The two creatures chosen by the user will takes turns attacking each other (and applying special abilities when necessary), while displaying the overall strength(health) of each creature at the end of each round.
- This will repeat until one of the two creatures has died.
- After one of the two creatures has died, the overall strength(health) of each creature will display one final time, and then the battle will officially end, and will display who has died (“lost the battle”).
